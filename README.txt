Things have not been going well this decade, and in the last few days major cyber hostilities have
broken out between the superpowers. Three hours ago all social media went off the Internet, and
email and other forms of communication have become extremely unreliable. As a founding member
of the League of Little Nations, Iceland has been asked by the Dutchy of Grand Fenwick to lead
the development of alternative and robust peer-to-peer forms of communication for the citizens of
the remaining democractic countries.   
   
To this end you will write a simple store and forward botnet message server, with accompanying
Command and Control (C&C) client, following the specification below.   
   
The overall goal is to link your server and client into a class wide botnet, which provides
alternative routes for messages, and is not subject to the single points of failure that the old social
media empires were vulnerable to. In order to do this, you will need to give some thought to
routing messages through the network, connecting to and leaving the botnet, storing messages for
disconnected servers, message expiry, and handling messages for other groups.   
   
Remember also that there is other information besides that purely in the messages â€“ for example,
knowing which link to your server the message arrived on, and which server is at the other end of
that link.   
   
There are also mysterious Number Servers, sending messages seemingly pointlessly and randomly into the network. Can you find them? Can you read their messages?
